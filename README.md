### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sandaru Madhubhashana from Sri Lanaka. Currently following a BSc (Hons) Degree in Information Technology specialising in Software Engineering. Experienced with creating full-stack applications and mobile applications. Iâ€™m passionate about creating software that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, and Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges to tackle. I really like clean and minimal interfaces as opposed to flashy and colourful ones.
